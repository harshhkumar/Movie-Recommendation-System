# Movie Recommender System

## Project Overview
The TMDB Movie Recommender System is a sophisticated tool designed to enhance your movie-watching experience by providing personalized film suggestions. Built using Python, this system leverages the rich TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset, combining advanced machine learning techniques with natural language processing to accurately predict and recommend movies that align with user preferences.

## Features
1. Content-Based Filtering: Utilizes a refined algorithm to analyze movie characteristics such as genres, keywords, cast, and crew.
2. Natural Language Processing (NLP): Employs NLP to process and analyze movie overviews and metadata, enhancing the accuracy of recommendations.
3. Cosine Similarity: Calculates similarity scores between movies based on their features to identify the most relevant suggestions.
4. Data Preprocessing: Implements thorough preprocessing steps to clean and prepare the data for analysis, ensuring reliability and precision in recommendations.

## Technologies Used
1. Python: For overall programming and implementation of machine learning models.
2. Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and numerical operations.
3. Scikit-Learn: For building the recommendation engine using cosine similarity.
4. NLTK: Used for text processing and stemming in NLP operations.

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tmdb-movie-recommender.git

2. Install the required packages:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the system:

    python movie_recommender.py

## Usage
To get movie recommendations, simply input the title of a movie you like, and the system will display five movies that share similar themes and elements.
