# üé¨ Movie Recommendation System

A content-based movie recommendation system that suggests similar movies based on your selection. Built with Streamlit and powered by the TMDB dataset, it uses natural language processing and cosine similarity to find movie recommendations.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

### Content-Based Filtering
The system uses content-based filtering which recommends movies based on their similarity to a movie the user likes. The similarity is calculated using:

1. **Text Processing**:
   - Movie descriptions and genres are combined
   - TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization is applied
   - This converts text data into numerical vectors

2. **Similarity Calculation**:
   - Cosine similarity is computed between all movies
   - Creates a similarity matrix for quick recommendations
   - Movies with highest similarity scores are recommended
